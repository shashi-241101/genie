A service fee, also known as a service charge, is a fee collected to pay for services related to the product or product service. It’s a standard practice applied in a variety of industries, from banking to travel and tourism, to eCommerce. When collected, these charges cover services rendered to the consumer as well as administrative or processing costs such as customer support.  I did not receive any email confirmation of my purchase. Please check that you used correct email address when you made your purchase. Just in case, also check your spam folder. You can also check your orders in ‘My Library’ where all the information, including the key, is provided. Please also check if the transaction was successful and you received a payment confirmation from your payment provider. If you still cannot find any information about the particular purchase please contact our Support Team. Payments What are the available paying methods on Driffle? We support a great variety of payment methods, in order to provide the best services and satisfy all of our customers. Therefore you can select from UPI, debit and credit cards, Net Banking, and more. The payment methods made available to you on the checkout page are limited by the vendor, your region, and the type of product you’re trying to buy. If you don’t see a specific payment method in the list, it means that, sadly, you won’t be able to use it to complete this purchase.  What should I do if my transaction has failed? In case the transaction was rejected please make sure that: You have enough balance available; You have provided correct personal information; If all of the above are correct, your balance will be returned to your account. In case you haven’t received it back, please contact our Support Team. Accounts Do I need to register an account in order to purchase? You can easily start buying products from our platform without registration. Just pick a product that you like, put it to your cart and buy it whenever you want or select ‘Buy Now’ and buy it right now. You will simply need to write your e-mail address and go to payment. We would still recommend you to create an account if you want to track all of your purchases in one place since that would give you an access to your purchase library. Registration would also give you access to other features, thus you would be able to fully explore Driffle.   My IP was blocked from accessing your site, what should I do? If you have received an error saying that your IP is blocked please make sure: You are not using VPN or Proxy. Clean cookies and cache. Try to use a different browser. If you have tried all of the above and still experiencing issues please contact our Support Team. Products I redeemed a key on Steam, but the game disappeared from my library. If you received a message that a game was removed from your Steam library, please submit a ticket to Support providing these screenshots: Notification message from Steam Support, informing about the game being removed from your account; Your Games Library where the revoked game details are visible; Your Steam account licenses and product key activations. Please make sure that the screenshots are fullscreen and show your computers date and time.  When I try to activate my product key I receive an error, what should I do? If you receive an ‘invalid’ error message while trying to activate a game, do not worry. Before creating a ticket please make sure that: You are activating the game on appropriate platform; Double check if the code you typed in is correct; If you are certain that the above criteria are met and the key is still not working, simply create a Support ticket.  If you receive an error message that your code has already been used, please make sure to do the following: Before you submit a support ticket, try to log out from your account, and the log in again; Recheck your library, since it can take some time for game to appear in the list; If game will not appear in your library, contact our Support Team with all the details about your issue. In case your key is region locked, it means you purchased a game that is not supported in your region or country. Note: in all of these cases, when you contact the Support Team about your issue, please provide all the needed information, included screenshots of the error, to make the resolve as smooth and quick as possible.  Where can I see if your product can be activated in my country? Most games on Driffle can be activated anywhere, however, some might be available to certain regions only.

After purchasing on Driffle you will receive your product key in 2 ways and can check it through: Your Driffle account, My Library section (Only available if you’re a registered user); Your email (don’t forget to check your spam/ junk folder).  I can’t see my purchased key If you received your key via email or Driffle library but are having trouble to display your purchased key, there might be several reasons that might have caused this issue.

Driffle Plus is a program designed for buyers only.    Driffle eSIM  How can I install my new eSIM? The eSIM card needs to be installed through your device's Settings outside of the Driffle website. Once you complete your eSIM purchase on Driffle, you will receive an email with instructions on how to install and activate your eSIM. Simply head over to the email and follow the instructions for installing your eSIM. Note that internet access is required to download and activate the eSIM profile to your cellular setting. We strongly recommend that you install (not activate) your eSIM on your phone soon after purchase and then wait to activate the plan when you are ready to use it. To get a detailed insight on how to install and activate your eSIM, you can read the Installation and Activation Guide.  How long can I use an eSIM? Our plans come with various expiry options, such as seven days, 30 days, 60 days, and more. Selecting a plan with an appropriate expiry period ensures that you have sufficient data for your intended usage duration. You also have the flexibility to add extra data to your existing eSIM before it expires or depletes, avoiding the inconvenience of installing a new eSIM.  How can I add more data to my eSIM? You can add more data to an active plan (data is not depleted and expiry has not passed) on the website by navigating to the My eSIM page -> specific eSIM and clicking "Add more data". We recommend doing this sooner rather than later because if your eSIM expires or your data is depleted, you will no longer be able to add to it.  How do I check the data usage on my eSIM? On the My eSIM tab of the Driffle website, you can manage your eSIMs and view information such as your data usage, how much data you have left, and how long before your plan expires. Follow the following steps to check the data usage on your eSIM: Go to Driffle website > Go to the My eSIMs page > Choose the data plan you want to check  When should I activate my eSIM? You should install ( not activate!) your eSIM as soon as you purchase your plan. When you are ready to use the data, you can activate your plan by hitting the "Activate Now" button on the website, or by turning on the phone and starting to use data. The method for activating data depends on the individual plan and is explained in your installation instructions. In most cases, a stable cinnection would be required while activating the data, so it is suggested to do it before arriving at your destination. NOTE: Installing and activating the eSIM are two different things. The plan expires only when you activate it; installing your eSIM beforehand will not cause it to expire.  How many eSIMs can I have? Presently, iOS permits you to download up to 10 eSIM profiles onto your device. However, only one eSIM profile can be activated at a time. You can switch between active eSIM profiles by navigating to your iOS Settings > Cellular and selecting the desired profile. This functionality provides users with the flexibility to manage multiple eSIM profiles on their device, allowing for seamless transitions between different plans or carriers as needed.  **JYSK Activation Guide**  To activate your JYSK Gift Card:  1.
